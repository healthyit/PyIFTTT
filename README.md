# PyIFTTT
If This Than That - The python version to drive your own IOT and Automation Projects. 

If you are familiar with the website IFTTT (https://ifttt.com/),  this is the python version. IFTTT is awesome, but it a drag and drop tool of pre-approved app's that they have verified. This means it doesn't do complex logic and you can't add your own apps or functionality to exist apps - just use what's there and working. Again it's awesome but as a developer it's frustrating not to be able to close the gaps.

It you are not familiar with it its a automation and workflow engine that people use with IOT and other automation projects. The basic principle is you add some conditions and an action to do if those conditions are meet. It's a simple but powerfull tool have a play.

## What Does PyIFTTT add
* Multiple conditions
* Multiple actions
* Add an Else for actions where the condition is not met
